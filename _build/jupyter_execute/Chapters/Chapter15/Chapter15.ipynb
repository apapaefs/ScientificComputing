    "You can think of a neural network as a nonlinear function of many variables that depends on many parameters. One way to represent neural networks looks like the diagram below, with each blob representing a neuron in the network. In the network shown below, each neuron in the network provides a weighted input into the next layer of neurons. \n",

    "Considering the simple example below, the output of the three neurons in the input layer $\\ell=0$ (taken to be identical as the input parameters), $a^0_k$, for $k=1,2,3$, provide a weighted input into the second layer $\\ell=1$: $z^1_1 = \\sum_k w_{1k}^1 a^0_k + b_1^1$. The output of the second layer is then $a^1_1 = \\sigma(z^1_1)$, where $\\sigma(z)$ represents the activation function. We will understand how all of this works in this chapter.\n",

    "It is simpler to start by considering what are known as perceptrons. A perceptron takes as input binary inputs $x_1, x_2, \\dots$, and produces a single binary output. As an example, consider three binary inputs $x_1, x_2, x_3$: \n",

    "The weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$ express the importance of respective inputs to the output. The output is binary: it can be either 0 or 1. This output is determined by whether the weighted sum, $\\sum_j w_j x_j$ is less than or greater than some threshold value $\\theta$, a real number which is a parameter of the output neuron. We can express the output, $y$ mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j \\leq \\theta,\\\\\n",
    "1, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j > \\theta~.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a specific example for simplicity. Suppose you are deciding whether to take an elective course in [High Energy Magic](https://wiki.lspace.org/High_Energy_Magic_Building) (MAGIC 3500K). There are three factors that will help you decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do you like the subject? ($x_1 = 1$ if yes, $x_1=0$ if not),\n",
    "2. Is the instructor highly rated on RateMyWizard.com? ($x_2 = 1$ if highly rated, $x_2 = 0$ if not), and\n",
    "3. Are any of your friends also taking the course? ($x_3 = 1$ if yes, $x_3 = 0$ if not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each factor weighs differently in your decision $y$. Let's suppose you are very interested in learning the fundamentals of High Energy Magic, therefore you assign a weight $w_1 = 0.6$ to the first factor. You weigh the instructor rating on RateMyWizard.com as $w_2 = 0.2$, and whether any of your friends are also taking the course $w_3 = 0.2$. If you now choose a threshold of $\\theta = 0.5$, say, you would end up only taking the course only if you like the subject, whereas the second and third factors would be irrelevant. If you choose the threshold to be $\\theta=0.3$, however, you could take the course if the instructor is highly rated and some of your friends are taking the course, or if you just like the subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify things by moving the threshold to the right-hand side of the equality and instead write, defining the bias, $b\\equiv-\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j + b \\leq 0,\\\\\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias $b$ represents how easy it is to get the perceptron to output 1. In biological terms, this would represent how easy it is to get the perceptron to \"fire\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now that we have a network of perceptrons that we would like to train to learn how to solve a particular problem. For example, the inputs to the network could be identified photos of cats or dogs, converted into raw pixel data. We would like the network to learn the weights and biases so that the network correctly identifies an arbitrary photo as a cat or a dog. Suppose we make a small variation in some weight (or bias) in the network. We would like this small variation to cause only a small corresponding change in the output. If we write the weights and biases in terms of a vector $\\bf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)$, then we want small changes of the form $\\bf{w} \\to \\bf w + \\Delta w$ to cause a small change in the output $y + \\Delta y$. We could then use this to modify weights and biases to get our network to behave in the way that we want, e.g. via some optimization procedure (we will do this later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, small changes in weights and biases of a single perceptron in the network can sometimes cause the output of a perceptron to flip, e.g. from 0 to 1. This may cause the behavior of the rest of the network to change completely in some complicated way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can overcome this problem by introducing a new type of artificial neuron, which we call sigmoid neuron, which we turn to next. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sigmoid Neurons \n",
    "\n",
    "A sigmoid neuron is very similar to a perceptron, with the difference being that its output is not constrained to be 0 or 1; instead it is $\\sigma(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b)$. In this case, $\\sigma$ is a continuous function that interpolates between 0 and 1. Two frequently used examples are the sigmoid function:\n",

    "z, & \\mathrm{if}~z> 0~.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "which can also be written as $\\mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0,z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we get for the change in the output: \n",

    "\n",
    "The architecture of neural networks was shown in Figure 1. There is generally an input layer, several hidden layers and an output layer. Sometimes such networks are known as \"multilayer perceptrons\" (MLPs). The design of the neural network is a form of art, that requires heuristic arguments. "

    "Suppose we have a training input $\\mathbf{x}$ of dimension $D_\\mathrm{in}$ that generates an output $\\mathbf{y}$ of dimension $D_\\mathrm{out}$. For example $\\mathbf{x}$ could represent each of the pixels in a photo of a dog or a cat, and $\\mathbf{y}$ could be appropriately chosen to tell us whether the particular photo is that of a dog or a cat. In this case, e.g. $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2)$ is the output, and we could choose $\\mathbf{y} = (1,0)$ to represent a dog and $\\mathbf{y} = (0,1)$ to represent a cat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find the appropriate weights and biases of the network, $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, respectively, such that the network yields the correct $\\mathbf{y}(\\mathbf{x})$ for a given (known) set of $\\mathbf{x}$. E.g. if we input a picture of a dog, then we want the *predicted* value, i.e. the output of the network, $\\mathbf{a}$ to be $\\mathbf{a}=(1,0)$. \n",

    "How well we are achieving this can be quantified by the \"loss\" or \"cost\" function, $C(\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{b})$. If we have several inputs $\\mathbf{x}$, each represented by a vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$, then an appropriate function could the the *quadratic loss*:\n",
