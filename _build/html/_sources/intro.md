# An Introduction to Scientific Computing (with Particle Physics Phenomenology)

## Introduction

This book is derived from material constructed for the purposes of the
"Computational Physics I (PHYS 3500K)" course at Kennesaw State University, as well as introductory material for research in particle physics phenomenology. 

Here, you will find examples and notes, as well as additional material.
