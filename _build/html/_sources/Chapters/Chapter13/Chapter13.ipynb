    "# A Brief Introduction to Monte Carlo Event Generators in Particle Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrating for the Cross Section\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will extend our Monte Carlo integration method to perform an integral to get the *cross section* for a specific process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the cross section is defined as (See Mark Thomson, page 70): \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma=$ (number of particles per unit time per target particle)/(incident flux),\n",
    "\n",
    "and an expression for $2 \\rightarrow 2$ scattering was derived, in the center-of-mass (C.O.M.) frame: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma = \\frac{1}{64 \\pi^2 s}\\frac{p_f^*}{p_i^*} \\int |\\mathcal{M}_{fi}|^2 \\mathrm{d} \\Omega^*$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $*$ indicates that the quantities are defined in the C.O.M. frame, and $s$ is the Mandelstam variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the physics of the process is encapsulated in tha matrix element $\\mathcal{M}_{fi}$. The rest of the expression is related to the \"kinematics\" of the process, i.e. energy and momentum conservation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d}{\\sigma} } { \\mathrm{d} \\Omega^*}$ is known as a differential cross section, so in order to find the total cross section $\\sigma$, we need to perform an integral over the solid angle $\\Omega^*$. Recall that $\\mathrm{d} \\Omega^* = \\mathrm{d} \\phi^* \\mathrm{d} (\\cos \\theta^*)$ (i.e. the solid angle element is the angular part of the spherical polar coordinate volume element). \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, integrals over differential cross sections will be complicated multi-differential and multi-dimensional functions of several variables, and therefore the Monte Carlo technique is the ideal method for solving them. In the first example we will consider here, the cross section can also be calculated analytically. However, we are going to use this as a first step towards understanding Monte Carlo event generators. "

    "## Monte Carlo Event Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the tutorial is primarily based on the article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4677. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar way to the Monte Carlo integration that we have previously discussed, we can scan over a function $f(x)$, and \"collect\" phase-space points, along with their associated \"probabilities\", that are proportional to the weight of each in the calculation for the integral. These points effectively correspond to possible \"events\", with their weights corresponding to their probability of occurring. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want to use these events, e.g. to perform an experimental analysis, then we must always carry the associated weight around for use in histograms, averages and so on. This can be inconvenient, but also very inefficient, as time may be wasted in some latter part of the simulation (e.g. a simulation of the effects of the detector) to events that possess only a very small weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"hit-or-miss\" method aims to equalize the weights of different events as far as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the weight of each event is proportional to the probability of occurring, we can unweighted the events by keeping only a fraction of them, according to their weights. We do this by finding the maximum weight which occurs in the integration region, while we are performing the Monte Carlo integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do this for $f(x) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$:"
