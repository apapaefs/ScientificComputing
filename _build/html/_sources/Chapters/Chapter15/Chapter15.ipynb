    "### The Theory of Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a neural network as a nonlinear function of many variables that depends on many parameters. One way to represent neural networks looks like the diagram below, with each blob representing a neuron in the network. In the network shown below, each neuron in the network provides a weighted input into the next layer of neurons. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the simple example below, the output of the three neurons in the input layer $\\ell=0$ (taken to be identical as the input parameters), $a^0_k$, for $k=1,2,3$, provide a weighted input into the second layer $\\ell=1$: $z^1_1 = \\sum_k w_{1k}^1 a^0_k + b_1^1$. The output of the second layer is then $a^1_1 = \\sigma(z^1_1)$, where $\\sigma(z)$ represents the activation function. We will understand how all of this works in this chapter.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is simpler to start by considering what are known as perceptrons. A perceptron takes as input binary inputs $x_1, x_2, \\dots$, and produces a single binary output. As an example, consider three binary inputs $x_1, x_2, x_3$: \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$ express the importance of respective inputs to the output. The output is binary: it can be either 0 or 1. This output is determined by whether the weighted sum, $\\sum_j w_j x_j$ is less than or greater than some threshold value $\\theta$, a real number which is a parameter of the output neuron. We can express the output, $y$ mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j \\leq \\theta,\\\\\n",
    "1, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j > \\theta~.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a specific example for simplicity. Suppose you are deciding whether to take an elective course in [High Energy Magic](https://wiki.lspace.org/High_Energy_Magic_Building) (MAGIC 3500K). There are three factors that will help you decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do you like the subject? ($x_1 = 1$ if yes, $x_1=0$ if not),\n",
    "2. Is the instructor highly rated on RateMyWizard.com? ($x_2 = 1$ if highly rated, $x_2 = 0$ if not), and\n",
    "3. Are any of your friends also taking the course? ($x_3 = 1$ if yes, $x_3 = 0$ if not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each factor weighs differently in your decision $y$. Let's suppose you are very interested in learning the fundamentals of High Energy Magic, therefore you assign a weight $w_1 = 0.6$ to the first factor. You weigh the instructor rating on RateMyWizard.com as $w_2 = 0.2$, and whether any of your friends are also taking the course $w_3 = 0.2$. If you now choose a threshold of $\\theta = 0.5$, say, you would end up only taking the course only if you like the subject, whereas the second and third factors would be irrelevant. If you choose the threshold to be $\\theta=0.3$, however, you could take the course if the instructor is highly rated and some of your friends are taking the course, or if you just like the subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify things by moving the threshold to the right-hand side of the equality and instead write, defining the bias, $b\\equiv-\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j + b \\leq 0,\\\\\n",
    "1, & \\mathrm{if}~\\sum_j w_j x_j + b > 0~.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias $b$ represents how easy it is to get the perceptron to output 1. In biological terms, this would represent how easy it is to get the perceptron to \"fire\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now that we have a network of perceptrons that we would like to train to learn how to solve a particular problem. For example, the inputs to the network could be identified photos of cats or dogs, converted into raw pixel data. We would like the network to learn the weights and biases so that the network correctly identifies an arbitrary photo as a cat or a dog. Suppose we make a small variation in some weight (or bias) in the network. We would like this small variation to cause only a small corresponding change in the output. If we write the weights and biases in terms of a vector $\\bf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)$, then we want small changes of the form $\\bf{w} \\to \\bf w + \\Delta w$ to cause a small change in the output $y + \\Delta y$. We could then use this to modify weights and biases to get our network to behave in the way that we want, e.g. via some optimization procedure (we will do this later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, small changes in weights and biases of a single perceptron in the network can sometimes cause the output of a perceptron to flip, e.g. from 0 to 1. This may cause the behavior of the rest of the network to change completely in some complicated way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can overcome this problem by introducing a new type of artificial neuron, which we call sigmoid neuron, which we turn to next. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sigmoid Neurons \n",
    "\n",
    "A sigmoid neuron is very similar to a perceptron, with the difference being that its output is not constrained to be 0 or 1; instead it is $\\sigma(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b)$. In this case, $\\sigma$ is a continuous function that interpolates between 0 and 1. Two frequently used examples are the sigmoid function:\n",

    "z, & \\mathrm{if}~z> 0~.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "which can also be written as $\\mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0,z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we get for the change in the output: \n",

    "The architecture of neural networks was shown in Figure 1. There is generally an input layer, several hidden layers and an output layer. Sometimes such networks are known as \"multilayer perceptrons\" (MLPs). The design of the neural network is a form of art, that requires heuristic arguments. "

In this case, e.g. $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2)$ is the output, and we could choose $\\mathbf{y} = (1,0)$ to represent a dog and $\\mathbf{y} = (0,1)$ to represent a cat. \n",

    "Our goal is to find the appropriate weights and biases of the network, $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, respectively, such that the network yields the correct $\\mathbf{y}(\\mathbf{x})$ for a given (known) set of $\\mathbf{x}$. E.g. if we input a picture of a dog, then we want the *predicted* value, i.e. the output of the network, $\\mathbf{a}$ to be $\\mathbf{a}=(1,0)$. \n",

    "Let's write down the necessary equations and outline the procedure for training a simple neural network, with one hidden layer. We will create $N=64$ training samples $\\mathbf{x}$ of dimension $D_\\mathrm{in}=1000$ each, and with outputs $\\mathbf{y}$, with dimension $D_\\mathrm{out}=10$. Therefore, the matrix $\\mathbf{x}$ will have dimension $N\\times D_\\mathrm{in} = 64 \\times 1000$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ will have dimensions $N \\times D_\\mathrm{out}=64 \\times 10$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer will have dimension $H=100$. Therefore the weights $\\mathbf{w}^2$ (from the input layer to the hidden layer) will have dimensions $D_\\mathrm{in} \\times H = 1000 \\times 100$ and the weights $\\mathbf{w}^3$ will have dimensions $H \\times D_\\mathrm{out} = 100 \\times 10$. The bias of the hidden layer, $\\mathbf{b}^2$ will be a vector of dimension $H$. There will be no activation function applied to the output layer (or, rather, the identity activation is used), although this varies according to what we are trying to achieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The forward propagation (pass) is achieved by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{a}^1 = \\mathbf{x}$, i.e. the activation of the input layer is simply the input training examples.\n",
    "- Then the input to the hidden layer is $\\mathbf{z}^2 =  \\mathbf{a}^1 \\cdot \\mathbf{w}^2+ \\mathbf{b}^2$. Note that since $\\mathbf{a}^1$ is $N \\times D_\\mathrm{in}$ and $\\mathbf{w}^2$ is $D_\\mathrm{in} \\times H$, the resulting product $\\mathbf{a}^1 \\cdot \\mathbf{w}^2$ is correctly $N \\times H$. When $\\mathbf{b}^2$ is added, NumPy treats $\\mathbf{b}^2$ as a $1 \\times H$ array and broadcasts (repeats) it $N$ times across the first dimension to match $N \\times H$.\n",
    "- The function $\\mathbf{a}^2 = \\sigma(\\mathbf{z}^2)$ is computed elementwise and has the same shape $N \\times H$.\n",
    "- The input to the output layer is provided as $\\mathbf{y}_\\mathrm{pred} =\\mathbf{a}^2 \\cdot \\mathbf{w}^3$, resulting in a $N \\times D_\\mathrm{out}$ array as required. \n",
    "\n",
    "The backpropagation and application of the gradient descent algorithm proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{\\Delta C}^3 = 2 (\\mathbf{y}_\\mathrm{pred} - \\mathbf{y})$ is calculated. Note that since there's no activation function applied to the output layer, $\\frac{ \\partial \\sigma } { \\partial z_j^3} = 1$ in this case.\n",
    "- Then the array $\\mathbf{\\Delta C}^2 = (\\mathbf{\\Delta C}^{3} \\cdot (\\mathbf{w}^{3})^T) \\odot \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial \\mathbf{z}^2}$ is calculated. Note that the Schur product, $\\odot$, is simply implemented by the ```*``` symbol in this case.\n",
    "- Then it's simple to obtain the gradients: $\\mathbf{\\nabla C}_{\\mathbf{w}^2} = (\\mathbf{a}^1)^T \\cdot \\mathbf{\\Delta C}^2$, $\\mathbf{\\nabla C}_{\\mathbf{w}^3} = (\\mathbf{a}^2)^T \\cdot \\mathbf{\\Delta C}^3$ and for the case of $\\mathbf{\\nabla C}_{\\mathbf{b}^2}$ we need to perform a sum over the $N$ rows of the $\\mathbf{\\Delta C}^2$ matrix using ```DeltaC2.sum(axis=0)```: \n",
    "$\\mathbf{\\nabla C}_{\\mathbf{b}^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{\\Delta C}^2_{i,:}$. \n",
    "- The gradients are then used to update the weights and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code that follows below, the above procedure is applied a certain number of times, or \"epochs\". We will run for 1000 epochs to obtain the optimal results."

    "- For a grayscale image, $C=1$.\n",
    "- For deeper layers in a CNN, $C$ is the number of feature maps produced by the previous convolution layer (e.g., after a `Conv2d(3,16,...)`, the next layer sees $C=16$ input channels).\n",

    "- the layer produces ```out_channels``` feature maps, each responding to a learned pattern.\n",
    "- padding is adding a border of (usually zero) pixels around an image/feature map before convolution, so the filter can be applied at the edges and the output spatial size can be controlled (often kept the same).\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you input an RGB image ($C_{\\text{in}}=3$) and your conv layer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then it has $C_{\\text{out}}=16$ filters, and it outputs 16 feature maps. Each map is $H\\times W$ (often the same spatial size as the input if padding/stride are chosen accordingly). The output shape per image is $(16, H, W)$. You can think of it as: \"instead of 3 color channels, I now have 16 learned channels,\" where each channel corresponds to one learned detector.\n",

    "### Classifying Cat and Dog Images \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here is to train a CNN to classify pictures of cats and dogs. We will use ```torchvision```, that has data loaders for common datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., torchvision.datasets and torch.utils.data.DataLoader. See https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the CIFAR10 dataset following the above tutoial. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load the CIFAR-10 dataset. The output of torchvision datasets are ```PILImage``` images. A PILImage is an image object from the \"Python Imaging Library ecosystem\", now maintained as Pillow (the modern fork of PIL. In practice, it is an instance of ```PIL.Image.Image``` that stores pixel data plus metadata (mode, size, etc.) and supports common image operations (resize, crop, rotate, convert color modes).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will transform them to Tensors of normalized range $[-1, 1]$. In what follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```transforms.Compose([...])``` means: apply the listed transforms in order.\n",
    "- ```transforms.ToTensor()```: Takes a PIL image (or NumPy array) with shape $(H, W, C)$ and converts it to a PyTorch tensor with shape $(C, H, W)$ and ```dtype``` ```float32```. It also rescales pixel values from integers in $[0, 255]$ to floats in $[0.0, 1.0]$.\n",
    "- ```transforms.Normalize(mean, std)``` with ```mean = (0.5,0.5,0.5)``` and ```std = (0.5,0.5,0.5)```: Normalizes each channel independently via:\n",
    "$x_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. Here, since $\\mu=0.5$ and $\\sigma=0.5$, this maps:\n",
    "\t- $x=0.0 \\mapsto -1.0$\n",
    "\t- $x=0.5 \\mapsto 0.0$\n",
    "\t- $x=1.0 \\mapsto 1.0$\n",
    "So after normalization, each channel is roughly in the range $[-1, 1]$, which often helps optimization behave more stably.\n"
